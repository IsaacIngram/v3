    <h1>Summer Orienteering</h1>
    <h3>Lab for CSCI-331: Intro to AI</h3>
    <p>In the sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">orienteering</a>, you are given a map with terrain information, including elevation, contours, and a set of locations to visit. Success requires a combination of athletic and planning skills - a smart competitor who can figure out the best way to traverse the terrain may beat a more athletic competitor who makes poor choices!</p>
    <p>In this lab, our goal was to create an algorithm to determine the best path between a list of coordinates given your ability to traverse different types of terrain.</p>
