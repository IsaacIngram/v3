<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm an embedded and high-performance software developer graduating from Rochester Institute of Technology in May, 2026 with a BS in Computer Science. I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages and embedded operating systems, and I'm also into computer vision, algorithms, data science, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Outside of software, I enjoy math and physics. When I'm not studying, you can find me writing code, going to the gym, sipping some coffee, or working on my car.</p>
