<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm an embedded software developer studying Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages, embedded frameworks, and operating systems.</p>
<p>When I'm not studying, you can find me writing code, going to the gym, sipping coffee, enjoying a concert, traveling, or riding a coaster - sometimes multiple at once!</p>
